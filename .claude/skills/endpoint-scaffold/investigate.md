description: Provides a structured 5-step debug protocol for Durable Object and WebSocket issues. Use when diagnosing DO/WebSocket failures, hibernation bugs, timer/alarm problems, or any SessionRoom.ts root-cause analysis.

# Skill: Investigating Bugs
# SCOPE: DO/WebSocket root-cause diagnosis
# LOAD: when debugging SessionRoom failures, WS disconnects, hibernation issues
# VERSION: v1.0.0
# OWNER: Backend/DevOps

## Role
Structured root-cause investigator for Durable Object and WebSocket failures. You diagnose bugs efficiently, minimize time-to-resolution, and escalate appropriately when tooling limits are reached.

## Preconditions / Inputs
- Session ID or reproducible scenario (browser, device, LIVE/DRAFT state)
- Error logs from `wrangler tail` or browser DevTools
- Access to SessionRoom.ts and WS protocol types
- Understanding of DO lifecycle (hibernation, alarms, tags)

## Workflow

Follow `.claude/skills/COMMON_RULES.md` for global constraints.

Structured debug workflow for Durable Object and WebSocket issues in Qesto.

## 5-Step Protocol

```
1. REPRODUCE  → Minimal scenario · LIVE vs DRAFT · Browser + device
2. OBSERVE    → wrangler tail · SessionRoom.ts logError · WS close codes
               (1001=away, 1006=abnormal, 4xxx=app)
3. HYPOTHESISE → Causal chain: "If X then Y because Z" · ruling-out list
4. TEST        → Minimal code change to prove/disprove · no refactoring during investigation
5. CONCLUDE   → Root cause in one sentence · fix or workaround · backlog item if > 30 min
```

## WS / DO Checklist

**Connection:**
- [ ] `SESSION_ROOM` binding in `wrangler.toml`?
- [ ] DO name: `env.SESSION_ROOM.idFromName(sessionId)`?
- [ ] Client sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on WS upgrade?

**Post-hibernation state:**
- [ ] `getTags(ws)` used — not in-memory map after restart?
- [ ] `voterMeta` rebuilt from tags (see `SessionRoom.ts:86-89`)?

**Alarm & timer:**
- [ ] `deleteAlarm()` called before `setAlarm()` on timer reset?
- [ ] Clock-drift guard present (500ms tolerance)?

**Broadcast:**
- [ ] `broadcastToRole('presenter', ...)` vs `broadcast(...)` — right choice?

**Audit regression checks:**
- [ ] Cached storage promises clear themselves on rejection?
- [ ] `webSocketMessage` has an outer guard around handler failures?
- [ ] Safe client error returned; internal error details only in logs?
- [ ] Follow-up messages still work after one handler fails?

## Common Bug Patterns

| Symptom | Most Likely Cause |
|---|---|
| Vote disappears after DO restart | `voterMeta` not rebuilt from tags |
| Timer stops early | Clock-drift not handled in `alarm()` |
| Presenter doesn't see votes | `broadcast` wrong role filter |
| DO unresponsive after `closeSession()` | Alarm not cleared before new alarm |
| WS disconnect loop | Token expired; client reconnects without new token |
| Emoji rate limit not working | `emojiRateLimits` map resets after hibernation — expected |
| All future votes fail after one storage blip | Cached rejected storage promise was not cleared |
| One malformed WS message breaks session | Missing outer handler try/catch |

## Log Commands

```bash
wrangler tail qesto --format pretty
wrangler tail qesto --format json | jq 'select(.logs[].message | test("error:"))'
```

## Escalate to Architect When

1. Root cause not found within 2 iterations of step 4
2. Fix requires DO migration (`[[migrations]]` in `worker/wrangler.toml`)
3. Bug only reproducible in production
4. Involves billing/Stripe state

## Quality Gates
- [ ] All 5 steps completed (REPRODUCE through CONCLUDE)
- [ ] Root cause stated in one sentence
- [ ] Evidence includes log line + code location
- [ ] Escalation path followed (see "Escalate to Architect When" section)

## Output Contract
Investigation report with these fields:
```markdown
## Investigation Report — <date>
**Problem**: <1-sentence>
**Environment**: <LIVE|DRAFT> · <browser/device> · <sessionId>
**Root Cause**: <1-sentence causal explanation>
**Evidence**: Log line + code location
**Fix**: <code change or workaround>
**Prevention**: <backlog item? Yes/No — ID>
```

## Docs to Update
- `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` for recurrent patterns
- `knowledge-base/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` if DO protocol changes needed
- GitHub issue with "investigation" label when root cause found

## Do Not
- Do not refactor during investigation — test hypothesis with minimal change only
- Do not ignore "common bug patterns" table — check it first
- Do not commit changes without running `npm test` and verifying in local environment
- Do not speculate on root cause — follow 5-step protocol to evidence
- Do not skip WS/DO checklist — hibernation state is the #1 cause

## Metrics
- Average time-to-root-cause per investigation
- Escalation rate (% requiring architect review)
- Recurrence rate (same bug appearing twice)
