## Source of Truth (this skill owns these — others reference, never copy)

### Ideal Customer Profile
| Persona | Role | Pain | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Facilitator** | Team lead, L&D manager, trainer | Passive meetings, no real-time feedback | Running live session > 5 people |
| **Event host** | Conference organizer, community manager | Audience disengagement | Running event or webinar |
| **HR professional** | People ops, engagement specialist | Anonymous pulse data, GDPR compliance | Needing anonymous team feedback |
| **Enterprise buyer** | IT or procurement | Security, SSO, audit logs | Company-wide tool evaluation |

Sweet spot: 10–500 employees; Enterprise (500+) via SSO + audit tier. Full personas:
`knowledge-base/product/research/CUSTOMER_PAIN_POINTS.md`.

### Core Competitors
| Competitor | Strength | Qesto Edge |
|---|---|---|
| **Mentimeter** | Brand awareness, slide integration | Privacy-first, no cold starts, AI insights, cheaper at scale |
| **Slido** | Cisco ecosystem, enterprise reach | No lock-in, edge performance, GDPR-native, fairer pricing |
| **Kahoot!** | Fun/gamification, brand | Serious facilitation, AI recap, team workflows |
| **Poll Everywhere** | US education market | Real-time edge, modern UX, multi-tenant teams |

Living battle cards: `knowledge-base/product/research/COMPETITOR_PROFILES.md`.
Marketing (E15) and Sales reference these tables — they must not duplicate them.

## Research Methodology by Data Source

Five sources. For each: when to use, how to research, what to look for. Fill results into
the matching template in `market-research-templates.md`.

### Source 1 — Competitor Websites
- **When**: features, pricing strategy, positioning, recent releases.
- **How**: scan product pages, pricing, blog/releases, case studies, about/positioning.
- **Look for**: feature parity gaps, pricing-model shifts, messaging shifts, target segments, integration strategy.
- **Cadence**: weekly scan for releases, monthly deep dive.

### Source 2 — Reddit & Developer Communities
- **When**: customer pain points, feature requests, switching triggers, unmet needs.
- **Where**: r/facilitation, r/events, r/training, r/HR, r/consulting, r/startup, HackerNews.
- **Look for**: "I wish X had…", explicit requests, switching language, tool comparisons, pricing sentiment, GDPR/privacy and anonymity demand, per-persona differences.
- **Cadence**: weekly sentiment scan (20–30 threads), monthly synthesis.

### Source 3 — Review Platforms (ProductHunt, G2, Capterra)
- **When**: satisfaction, feature requests, pricing perception, win/loss reasons.
- **How**: G2/Capterra competitor pages (Pros/Cons/Reason-for-switching, by company size); ProductHunt launches + comments.
- **Look for**: feature ratings, pricing satisfaction, support quality, integration demand, switching reasons, unmet needs, SMB vs Enterprise differences.
- **Cadence**: weekly for new reviews, monthly competitive deep dive.

### Source 4 — LinkedIn & Community Listening
- **When**: professional sentiment, job-market signals, facilitator/trainer/HR frustrations.
- **How**: hashtag monitoring (#facilitation, #training, #eventtech, #engagement, #HR-tech), post + company-mention search, job postings.
- **Look for**: pain language, tool mentions & sentiment, feature requests, segment insights, competitive switching, emerging trends, influencer voices.
- **Cadence**: weekly scan (20–30 posts), monthly influencer/trend analysis.

### Source 5 — Web Search & Industry Intelligence
- **When**: industry trends, analyst views, competitor announcements, market sizing.
- **How**: search competitor funding/launches/partnerships, industry trends, Gartner/Forrester, customer case studies, TAM/SAM, technical trends (edge, WebSocket, serverless).
- **Look for**: funding signals, partnerships, market sizing, analyst direction, architecture advantage, customer case studies.
- **Cadence**: ongoing, triggered by competitor news or trend changes.

## Collaboration with Product Owner (E1)

- **On-demand query** (2–3 h turnaround): research across sources → synthesize → strategic context → link to backlog story → cite sources. Use the *On-Demand Query Response* template.
- **Weekly Market Pulse**: scan competitors + sample communities/reviews → 1-page digest to `knowledge-base/product/research/WEEKLY_MARKET_PULSE.md`. Use the *Weekly Market Pulse* template.
- **Backlog annotation**: tag stories with evidence using the *Backlog Annotation* template.
- **Win/Loss**: synthesize win/loss with Sales (E17) using the *Win/Loss Analysis* template.

## Safety & Governance
- **Public sources only** — no internal customer data, no Qesto customer names.
- **Respect privacy** — anonymize community quotes; honor GDPR opt-out/deletion.
- **Factual, cited** — every claim has URL + date + sample size; report sample transparency and bias when small.
- **Positioning, not FUD** — emphasize genuine advantages; nuance over sensationalism.
- **No espionage** — public information only.

## Escalation & Edges
- Needs internal customer data → Product Owner
- Major market shift detected → recommend ADR-level strategic review (architect/PO)
- Unmet segment need found → backlog grooming with PO (E1)
- Analysis conflicts with documented positioning → positioning audit with marketing (E15)
- Win/loss product gaps from Sales (E17) → backlog with PO
